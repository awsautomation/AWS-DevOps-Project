# Advanced Demo - Web Identity Federation  

In this advanced demo series you will be implementing a simple serverless application which uses Web Identity Federation.    
The application runs using the following technologies  

- S3 for front-end application hosting  
- Google API Project as an ID Provider  
- Cognito and IAM Roles to swap Google Token for AWS credentials  

The application runs from a browser, gets the user to login using a Google ID and then loads all images from a private S3 bucket into a browser using presignedURLs.  

This advanced demo consists of 5 stages :-  

- STAGE 1 : Provision the environment and review tasks   
- STAGE 2 : Create Google API Project & Client ID  
- STAGE 3 : Create Cognito Identity Pool  
- STAGE 4 : Update App Bucket & Test Application **<= THIS STAGE**  
- STAGE 5 : Cleanup the account

# STAGE 4A - Download index.html and scripts.js from the S3   

Move to the S3 Console https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1    
Open the `webidf-appbucket-` bucket   
select `index.html` and click `Download` & save the file locally  
select `scripts.js` and click `Download` & save the file locally  

# STAGE 4B - Update files with your specific connection information  

Open the local copy of `index.html` in a code editor.    
Locate the `REPLACE_ME_GOOGLE_APP_CLIENT_ID` placeholder   
Replace this with YOUR CLIENT ID  
Save `index.html`  

Open the local copy of `scripts.js` in a code editor.   
Locate the IdentityPoolId: `REPLACE_ME_COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID` placeholder    
Replace the `REPLACE_ME_COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID` part with your IDENTITY POOL ID you noted down in the previous step  
Locate the `Bucket: "REPLACE_ME_NAME_OF_PATCHES_PRIVATE_BUCKET" ` placeholder.  
Replace `REPLACE_ME_NAME_OF_PATCHES_PRIVATE_BUCKET` with with bucket name of the `webidf-patchesprivatebucket-` bucket
Save `scripts.js`  

# STAGE 4C - Upload files

Back on the S3 console, inside the `webidf-appbucket-` bucket.   
Click `Upload`    
Add the `index.html` and `scripts.js` files and click `Upload`    

# STAGE 4C - Test application  

Open the `WebApp URL` you noted down earlier, the `distribution domain name` of the cloudfront distribution  
This is the web app, with no access to any AWS resources right now  
Open your browser `web developer tools` (firefox tool->browser tools-> web developer tools)  
it might be called browser console in other browsers, it will log any output from javascript running in your web browser.

With the browser console open, Click `Sign In`    
Sign in with your google account  
![](confirm-access-request.png)
When you click the Sign In button a few things happen:-  (watch the console)  
![](cognito-authentication-complete.png)
- You authenticate with the Google IDP  
- a Google Access token is returned  
- This token is provided as part of the API Call to Cognito  
- If successful this exchanges this for Temporary AWS credentials  
- These are used to list objects in the private bucket  
- for all objects, presignedURLs are generated and used to load the images in the browser.  

Once signed in you should see 3 cat pictures loaded from a private S3 bucket  
![](presigned-urls.png)
Click on each of them, notice the URL which is used? it's a presignedURL generated by the JS running in browser, using the API's which you can access using the cognito credentials.  

All of this is done with no self-managed compute.

# STAGE 4 - FINISH  

At this point you have a fully functional simple serverless application, complete with :-

- template front end app bucket
- Configured Google API Project
- Credentials to access it
- Cognito ID Pool
- IAM Roles for the ID Pool
- HTML and JS configured to access the Google IDP and Cognito
