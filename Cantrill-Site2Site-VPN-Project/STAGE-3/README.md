# AWS Side Routing

Because we're using a VGW ... we have two options, either adding routes manually or enabling route propegation so that any VGW learned routes will be added to the route table automatically - this is the option we will use for this mini project.  

Go to the `VPC` console, under `Virtual private cloud` click `Route Tables`.  
Select the `rt-aws` route table.  
Click `Routes` and notice how only the AWS VPC Local route of `10.16.0.0/16` exists.  
Click `Route Propegation`. 
Clikc `Edit Route Propegation`. 
Check `Enable` for `awsVGW`, then click `Save` 
Click `Routes` again and notice how a route for the onprem network `192.168.8.0/21` has been added via route propegation.

# Onprem Side Routing

Because we're using a VGW ... we have two options, either adding routes manually or enabling route propegation so that any VGW learned routes will be added to the route table automatically - this is the option we will use for this mini project.

Select the `rt-onprem-private` route table.  
Click `Routes` then `Edit Routes`

# AWS Side Security Groups
